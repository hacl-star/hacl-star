The following directories contain Vale and related tools:

* [tools/Vale/src](./tools/Vale/src): Vale
* [tools/Vale/test](./tools/Vale/test): test files for Vale
* [tools/Dafny](./tools/Dafny): Dafny binaries built from https://github.com/Microsoft/dafny
* [tools/Kremlin](./tools/Kremlin): Interface to [Kremlin](https://www.github.com/FStarLang/Kremlin)

The following directories contain library code and cryptographic code verified by Dafny and Vale:

* [src/lib](./src/lib): general-purpose libraries for Dafny
* [src/arch](./src/arch): definitions of assembly language architectures (x86, x64, ARM)
* [src/crypto](./src/crypto): verified cryptographic code
* [src/test](./src/test): test files for libraries, architecture code, and cryptography code

Dafny files with a suffix .s.dfy are specification files that are part of the trusted computing base.
Dafny files with a suffix .i.dfy and Vale files contain verified code that is not part of the trusted computing base.

Building Vale will create the following additional directories;
all files generated by the build should be in these directories:

* obj
* bin
