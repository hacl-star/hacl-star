ECDH: X25519
------------

HACL* implements the X25519 Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH)
construction `IETF RFC 7748 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7748>`_.
The library includes two implementations of this construction,
both with the same API, but meant for use on different platforms:

- ``Hacl_Curve25519_51.h`` contains a portable C implementation that
  is optimized for use on 64-bit platforms that support 128-bit arithmetic,
  but it will still compile and execute on 32-bit platforms (using an emulated
  128-bit arithmetic library provided by KreMLin).
- ``Hacl_Curve25519_64.h`` contains a hybrid C/assembly implementation:
  the field arithmetic functions are in Intel assembly (generated by Vale)
  and rely on the Intel ADX and BMI2 instruction sets; the elliptic curve
  functions and the main API are in portable C.

Both versions provide functions that can be used to generate Curve25519 keypairs
and use them to compute ECDH shared secrets.

Key Generation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Any 32 byte array can be used as a Curve25519 private key. In
practice, private keys should be generated using a cryptographically
strong pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG).  In some cases, the
private key may be derived as the result of a key derivation function
such as HKDF.

Given a private key, the corresponding public key can be computed
using the ``secret_to_public`` function:

.. literalinclude:: ../dist/portable-gcc-compatible/Hacl_Curve25519_51.h
    :language: c
    :start-after: SNIPPET_START: Hacl_Curve25519_51_secret_to_public
    :end-before: SNIPPET_END: Hacl_Curve25519_51_secret_to_public

.. literalinclude:: ../dist/portable-gcc-compatible/Hacl_Curve25519_64.h
    :language: c
    :start-after: SNIPPET_START: Hacl_Curve25519_64_secret_to_public
    :end-before: SNIPPET_END: Hacl_Curve25519_64_secret_to_public

The first argument is a pointer to the output public key ``pub``;
the second argument is a pointer to the input private key ``priv``.

ECDH Shared Secret
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ECDH operation is implemented by the following function:


.. literalinclude:: ../dist/portable-gcc-compatible/Hacl_Curve25519_51.h
    :language: c
    :start-after: SNIPPET_START: Hacl_Curve25519_51_ecdh
    :end-before: SNIPPET_END: Hacl_Curve25519_51_ecdh

.. literalinclude:: ../dist/portable-gcc-compatible/Hacl_Curve25519_64.h
    :language: c
    :start-after: SNIPPET_START: Hacl_Curve25519_64_ecdh
    :end-before: SNIPPET_END: Hacl_Curve25519_64_ecdh


The first argument is a pointer to the output shared secret ``out``;
the second argument is the private key of the caller ``priv``;
the last argument is the public key of the peer ``pub``.
The size of all three arrays must be (at least) 32 bytes.

The function returns a boolean since it may fail.
If the computed shared secret is an array of all zeroes,
then the function ``ecdh`` returns false to indicate that the operation failed.
Otherwise, it returns true.

Other Curves: P-256
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A development branch includes a verified implementation of P-256,
which has not yet been merged to master. Contact the HACL* maintainers
if you wish to use this code.
