# A High-Assurance Cryptographic Library

This repository contains verified code for a library of modern
cryptographic algorithms, including Curve25519, Ed25519, AES-GCM,
Chacha20, Poly1305, SHA-2, SHA-3, HMAC, and HKDF. This set of algorithms
is enough to support the full NaCl API and several TLS 1.3 ciphersuites.
The code for all of these algorithms is formally verified using the
[F\*](https://fstar-lang.org/) verification framework for memory
safety, functional correctness, and secret independence (resistance to
some types of timing side-channels).

## Status

*Warning*: This is the research home of HACL\*. If you are looking for
documentation, releases, language bindings and code that can be satisfactorily
integrated into a production project, please check out [HACL
packages](https://github.com/cryspen/hacl-packages/).

The code in this repository is divided into three closely-related sub-projects,
all developed as part of [Project Everest](https://project-everest.github.io/).

We are actively developing and integrating our code on the
[main](https://github.com/project-everest/hacl-star/tree/main/)
branch, which tracks F\*'s `master` branch.

## HACL\*

[HACL\*](code/) is a formally verified library
of modern cryptographic algorithms written in a subset of
[F\*](https://fstarlang.github.io) called Low\* and compiled to C
using a compiler called
[KaRaMeL](https://github.com/FStarLang/karamel). The Low\* source code
for each primitive is verified for memory safety, functional
correctness, and secret independence. The compiler generates
efficient, readable, standalone C code for each algorithm that
can be easily integrated into any C project.  We include the current C code for various HACL\*
algorithms in the [dist](dist/) directory. HACL\* can also be compiled to WebAssembly.

## ValeCrypt

[ValeCrypt](vale/) provides formally verified high-performance
cryptographic code for selected primitives in assembly language. It relies on the
[Vale tool](https://github.com/project-everest/vale) to produce
code and proofs in [F\*](https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar). Vale supports
multiple platforms and proves that its implementations are memory safe,
functionally correct, and that timing and memory accesses are secret
independent.

## EverCrypt

[EverCrypt](providers/evercrypt/) is a high-performance, cross-platform, formally
verified modern cryptographic provider that packages implementations from
HACL\* and ValeCrypt, and automatically picks the fastest one available,
depending on processor support and the target execution environment
(*multiplexing*). Furthermore, EverCrypt offers an (*agile*) API that makes it
simple to switch between algorithms (e.g., from SHA2 to SHA3).

## Citing HACL*

If you want to cite HACL\* in a research publication, here is some guidance to
make sure you pick the right publications.

- For HACL* in its current incarnation, including SIMD versions of algorithms: CCS'20.
