Performance tests for HACL*, written in C
-----------------------------------------

These tests are compiled by the local Makefile. They're executed when the user
runs `make test`.

Note: LTO is disabled since it causes a bunch of issues (not all systems have it
properly enabled; issues with MinGW in the past...). Also, I haven't noticed a
measurable performance improvement. If you wish to recompile the tests with LTO
enabled:

```
$ export AR=gcc-ar # if $CC is gcc
$ cd karamel/krmllib && git clean -fdx dist && CFLAGS=-flto make -j
$ cd hacl-star && git clean -fdx dist && CFLAGS=-flto make -j test
```
