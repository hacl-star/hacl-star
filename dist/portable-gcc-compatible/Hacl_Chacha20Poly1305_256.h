Decrypt a ciphertext `cipher` with key `k`.

The arguments `k`, `n`, `aadlen`, and `aad` are same in encryption/decryption.
Note: Encryption and decryption can be executed in-place, i.e., `m` and `cipher` can point to the same memory.

If decryption succeeds, the resulting plaintext is stored in `m` and the function returns the success code 0.
If decryption fails, the array `m` remains unchanged and the function returns the error code 1.
