Decrypt a ciphertext `input` with key `key`.

The arguments `key`, `nonce`, `data`, and `data_len` are same in encryption/decryption.
Note: Encryption and decryption can be executed in-place, i.e., `output` and `input` can point to the same memory.

If decryption succeeds, the resulting plaintext is stored in `output` and the function returns the success code 0.
If decryption fails, the array `output` remains unchanged and the function returns the error code 1.
