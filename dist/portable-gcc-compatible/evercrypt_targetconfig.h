// However, for maintenance purposes, we use the first method in
// order to have all the possible values listed in one place.
// Note that for now, the only important id is TARGET_ARCHITECTURE_ID_X64,
// but the other ids might prove useful in the future if we make
// the dynamic feature detection more precise (see the functions
// has_vec128_not_avx/has_vec256_not_avx2 below).

// Those functions are called on non-x64 platforms for which the feature detection
// is not covered by vale's CPUID support; therefore, we hand-write in C ourselves.
// For now, on non-x64 platforms, if we can compile 128-bit vector code, we can
// also execute it; this is true of: Z, Power, ARM8. In the future, if we consider
// cross-compilation scenarios, we'll have to refine this predicate; it could be the case,
// for instance, that we want our code to run on old revisions of a system without
// vector instructions, in which case we'll have to do run-time feature detection
// in addition to compile-time detection.
