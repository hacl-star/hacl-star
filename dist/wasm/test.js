// A demo file for using the low-level WHACL* (WASM-HACL*) bindings.
//
// Run this demo with `node main.js` from the `dist/wasm` directory of HACL*.
// Alternatively, `npm install -g http-server && http-server .` from
// `dist/wasm`, then open `main.html` in a browser to get the benefits of e.g.
// Chrome debugging.
//
// WHACL* (also known as hacl-wasm) compiles directly from F*/Low* to WASM using
// the krml compiler. This means that the resulting code is small,
// minimalistic, and does not link to libc. This also means that rather than
// trusting all of the LLVM optimizations passes, it suffices to audit the rules
// from the S&P'19 paper.
//
// There are two APIs for WHACL*:
// - the high-level API is JS-friendly, uses ArrayBuffer's, and copies data in
//   and out between JS and the WASM stack for each function call
// - the low-level API, which requires knowledge of the krml-wasm calling
//   convention.
//
// This file demonstrates how to use the latter efficiently.

// HELPERS

// Caveats:
// - right now, every single WASM file is loaded; this is inefficient, but will

  let m32 = new Uint32Array(mem.buffer);
  let sp = m32[0];

  // The `reserve` function grows the stack, and returns the address of the
  // freshly-allocated memory; it is the responsibility of the JS caller to
  // restore the stack afterwards. It is also the responsibility of the JS
  // caller to align memory by reserving dummy amounts of memory.

  // This function heap-allocates. Technically, heap allocations are not
  // supported by the WASM backend, but I added something specifically for
  // bignums.
  // - The heap is at the end of the memory.
  // - The last 32-bit integer in memory contains the current size of the heap.
  // - Each allocation is prefixed by an 8-byte header:
  //   - first 4 bytes = allocation size (including header)
  //   - next 4 bytes = reserved
  //   - data follows.
  // - Nothing is ever freed or compacted.
  // In short, treat the heap as a region allocator, with a single region.
  //
  // Conceivably, an advanced user could directly write out this representation
  // on the stack rather than go through the helper.
