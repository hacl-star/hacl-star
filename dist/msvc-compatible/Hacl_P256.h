P256 signature WITHOUT hashing first.

This function is intended to receive a hash of the input. For convenience, we
recommend using one of the hash-and-sign combined functions above.

The argument `m` MUST be at least 32 bytes (i.e. `mLen >= 32`).

NOTE: The equivalent functions in OpenSSL and Fiat-Crypto both accept inputs
smaller than 32 bytes. These libraries left-pad the input with enough zeroes to
reach the minimum 32 byte size. Clients who need behavior identical to OpenSSL
need to perform the left-padding themselves.
