/// Note: on fstar-master, we extract everything in a single invocation of
/// KaRaMeL. However, we cannot mix in the same C file functions that cannot
/// assume avx2 and functions that demand it, because the compiler will optimize
/// the fallback version with avx2 instructions, which will in turn generate
/// illegal instruction errors on some target machines.
///
/// The load_accN variants pose a problem, because they all end up in the same
/// file when, really, they should be in separate files to allow compiling each
/// C translation unit with the same flags.
///
/// One way to solve this problem is to mark them noextract
/// inline_for_extraction, as was done previously. Another way would be to fix
/// KaRaMeL to allow moving functions in a given module to other modules. A
/// third, more mundame fix is to split these functions in separate modules and
/// package them with their top-level bundle file, which will achieve the same
/// effect.
