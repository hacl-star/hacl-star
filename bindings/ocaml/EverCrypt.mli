module AEAD : sig
(** Agile, multiplexing AEAD interface exposing AES128-GCM, AES256-GCM, and Chacha20-Poly1305

    To use the agile AEAD interface, users first need to initialise an internal state
    using {!init}. This state will then need to be passed to every call to {!encrypt}
    and {!decrypt}. It can be reused as many times as needed.
    Users are not required to manually free the state.

    The [tag] buffer must be 16 bytes long. For [key] and [iv], each algorithm
    has different constraints:
    - AES128-GCM: [key] = 16 bytes , [iv] > 0 bytes
    - AES256-GCM: [key] = 32 bytes, [iv] > 0 bytes
    - Chacha20-Poly1305: [key] = 32 bytes, [iv] = 12 bytes

    To use the agile streaming interface, users first need to initialise an internal state using {!init}.

    Users are not required to manually free the state.

    When using the streaming interface, the total number of bytes passed through {!update} must not exceed
    - 2{^61} for SHA-224, SHA-256, and the legacy algorithms
    - 2{^125} for SHA-384 and SHA-512

(** Agile, multiplexing hashing interface, exposing 4 variants of SHA-2
    (SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512), BLAKE2, and 2 legacy algorithms (SHA-1, MD5).
    It offers both direct hashing and a streaming interface.

    {i Note:} The agile BLAKE2 interface is NOT currently multiplexing and it only exposes the portable C
    implementations of BLAKE2b and BLAKE2s. Optimised, platform-specific versions are aviailable
    in {{!Hacl.blake2}Hacl}.

    For [digest], its size must match the size of the digest produced by the algorithm being used:
    - SHA-224: 28 bytes
    - SHA-256: 32 bytes
    - SHA-384: 48 bytes
    - SHA-512: 64 bytes
    - BLAKE2b: <= 64 bytes
    - BLAKE2s: <= 32 bytes

    {b The {{!SharedDefs.HashDefs.deprecated_alg}legacy algorithms} (marked [deprecated]) should NOT be used for cryptographic purposes. }
    For these, the size of the digest is:
    - SHA-1: 20 bytes
    - MD5: 16 bytes

(** Agile, multiplexing interface for HMAC

The hashing algorithms currently supported are the same as for the {{!EverCrypt.Hash}agile hashing interface}:
    - SHA-2 (SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512)
    - BLAKE2 (BLAKE2b, BLAKE2s)

      For HMAC with SHA2, the output buffer is the same size as the digest size of
      the corresponding hash function (see {{!EverCrypt.Hash} here}). For HMAC with BLAKE2,
      the output buffer is 64 bytes for BLAKE2b and 32 bytes for BLAKE2s.

    The supported hashing algorithms are SHA2-256, SHA2-384, SHA2-512.

    Users first need to instantiate an internal state with a compatible hashing algorithm and an
    optional but recommended personalization string. The [generate] or [Noalloc.generate] functions
    can then be called any number of times.

    Users have the possibility to reseed, but it is not required.
