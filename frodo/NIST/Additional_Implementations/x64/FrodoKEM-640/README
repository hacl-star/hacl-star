Learning with Errors Key Encapsulation: FrodoKEM-640
Optimized implementation for x64 platforms with AES_NI and AVX2 support
=======================================================================

Simply do:

$ make clean; make

And then execute the following to run the tests:

$ ./frodo/test_KEM

Or execute the following to run the KATs:

$ ./frodo/PQCtestKAT_kem

By default, AES128 is used to generate the matrix "A", OpenSSL's AES implementation
is used for AES, and compilation is performed with GNU GCC.


ADDITIONAL OPTIONS
------------------

make CC=[gcc/clang] GENERATION_A=[AES128/CSHAKE128] USE_OPENSSL=[TRUE/FALSE]

If OpenSSL is being used and is installed in an alternate location, use the following make options:
    OPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/to/openssl/include
    OPENSSL_LIB_DIR=/path/to/openssl/lib

When using GENERATION_A=CSHAKE128, execute the following to run the KATs:

$ ./frodo/PQCtestKAT_kem_cshake
